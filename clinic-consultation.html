            <h3>What can I expect as a new patient?</h3>
            <p>
              When you arrive to our practice one of our reception staff will
              get check you in. Following this you will be seen by an Orthoptist
              who will conduct the initial examination and complete any
              necessary testing before you see the ophthalmologist. You may need
              to have dilating drops instilled, which need time to work before
              you can see the ophthalmologist.
            </p>
            <p>
              The ophthalmologist will then see you and conduct their
              examination. Depending on their findings they may or may not
              request more tests to be done by the Orthoptist in which case you
              will have those done before seeing the ophthalmologist again.
            </p>
            <h3 class="mt-5">Why do I need to have dilating drops?</h3>

            <p>
              Dilating drops are used to enlarge your pupil so that the
              Ophthalmologist can get a much wider and better view of the back
              of your eye. As the pupil becomes larger, more light enters the
              eye and as a result patients may experience a sensitivity to
              light/glare. It also becomes difficult to focus and vision becomes
              blurred, especially at near (reading/phone/computer). The effects
              of the drops can last for several hours and as a result, we
              recommend that you do not drive after having dilating drops. It is
              often helpful to bring along a pair of dark sunglasses to minimise
              the glare.
            </p>
            <h3 class="mt-5">
              How long will an ophthalmologist appointment take?
            </h3>
            <p>
              Please allow 1-2 hours for your consultation. Extra time maybe
              required for diagnostic tests and minor procedures to be performed
              on the day.
            </p>
            <p>
              We endeavour to run as close to appointment times as possible.
              However, as we often need to fit-in urgent cases there may be
              unavoidable delays.
            </p>
            <h3 class="mt-5">
              Do I need a referral for my ophthalmologist appointment?
            </h3>
            <p>
              We will need a current and valid referral from either your GP,
              optometrist or specialist. A referral from your GP or optometrist
              will be valid for 12 months. A referral from another specialist
              will be valid for 3 months only. We will endeavour to notify you
              if your referral has expired but it is your responsibility to
              ensure that it is current. Without a current referral Medicare
              will not be able to process a refund into your account.
            </p>
            <h3 class="mt-5">
              Do I receive money back from my private health fund for my
              consult?
            </h3>
            <p>
              Unfortunately, private health funds do not provide a rebate for
              consults. Your health fund however may provide you benefits if you
              require a procedure (e.g. cataract surgery)
            </p>
            <h3 class="mt-5">What do I need to bring to my appointment?</h3>
            <p>

              bring along:

                Sunglasses to help with glare if your eyes are being dilated
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="mt-5">
              Will I be required to pay for my ophthalmologist appointment on
              the day?
            </h3>
            <p>

              expected that it be settled on the day of consultation.

            <p>
              We encourage all patients to register with their banking details
              with Medicare so that we are able to claim from Medicare on your
