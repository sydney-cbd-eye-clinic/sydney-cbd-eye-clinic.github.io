                <p>Cataract is the term used to describe opacification (or clouding) of the eyes natural lens. As it
                    blocks the light
                    path
                    entering your eye, some common symptoms include: blurred vision, glare, halo and difficulty reading.
                    It is a process
                    which comes with time, and surgery is currently the most effectively form of treatment for this.</p>

                    <p>Cataract forms with age and is common amongst elderly. Some other causes include medications(
                        steroids), retinal

                <h3>How is cataract treated ?</h3>
                <div class="cbd-card-content">
                    <p>Cataract surgery is a safe and highly developed treatment for removing the cloudy cataract and
                        replacing it with an
                        artificial lens. This is done through a very small incision on the clear part of the eye. The
                        incision is so small it
                        usually self-seals and doesn’t require sutures. The vast majority of cataract patients have no
                        complications during or
                        following the surgery.
                        A full recovery from surgery can range from a short few days to few months. Most patients will
                        see clearer the next day
                        after surgery.

                <h3>What are the risks or side effects of the operation?</h3>
                <div class="cbd-card-content">

                    <strong>Gritty discomfort in the eye</strong>
                    <p>This is common the next day after surgery, and it should resolve within hours.</p>
                    <strong>Inflammation</strong>
                    <p>This is common following surgery of the eye, the eyedrops prescribed will be helpful in settling
                        this.</p>
                    <strong>Swelling</strong>
                    <p>In the eye, swelling can offer in the front of the eye (cornea) or the back of the eye following
                        surgery. Most of these
                        will usually resolve with eye drops.</p>
                    <strong>Need for glasses</strong>
                    <p>It is common that most patient will need glasses if not for near, then for distance sometimes.
                        This
                        will be discussed
                        during your consultations.</p>
                    <strong>Second operation</strong>
                    <p>While the aim of the surgery is to take the cataract out, sometimes the cataract may escape
                        deeper
                        into the eye. If this
                        happens, a second surgery will be required to remove the cataract completely. Your vision may be
                        blurred during before
                        the second surgery is complete.
                        Retinal detachment occurring after cataract surgery is uncommon, this will also require a second
                        surgery to repair the
                        retina.</p>
                    <strong>Infection</strong>
                    <p>This complication while rare (&lt;1:1000), can be sight threatening. If your operated eye becomes
                        red, painful and vision
                        drops few days after surgery, please contact the surgery urgently or go to the nearest emergency
                        department
                        immediately.</p>
                    <strong>Posterior capsular opacification</strong>
                    <p>It can be common to see that the artificial lens
                        becomes a bit cloudy
                        (which may mimick cataracts again). This can be easily cleaned by our doctors using lasers in
                        eye
                        clinic.</p>

                <h3>Preparing for the surgery?</h3>
                <div class="cbd-card-content">
                    On the day of surgery, you will first attend the CBD eye clinic to check in and have eye drops in
                    the eye. The eyedrops
                    will dilate the pupil of the eye planned for surgery.
                    When the dilating drops have worked, we will guide you to the operating theaters of Sydney Eye
                    Hospital. Which is just a
                    short walk away.

                <div class="cbd-card-content">
                    <p>The cataract surgery is done under local anaesthesia. It will involve that you relax and lie flat
                        on your back during
                        the operation. Vast majority of the surgery will take about 10mins, however more complex cases
                        may take longer depending
                        on the condition of the cataract.</p>
                    <p>After the surgery, there will be an eye patch covering the operated eye. Please ensure that you
                        have friend or family
                        who will be able to take you home and look after you</p>
