            <h1>Cataract Surgery</h1>
            <p>
              Cataract is the term used to describe opacification (or clouding)
              of the eyes natural lens. As it blocks the light path entering
              your eye, some common symptoms include: blurred vision, glare,
              halo and difficulty reading. It is a process which comes with
              time, and surgery is currently the most effectively form of
              treatment for this.

            <h3>What causes cataracts ?</h3>
            <div class="cbd-card-content">
              <p>
                Cataract forms with age and is common amongst elderly. Some
                other causes include medications( steroids), retinal surgery,
                previous eye trauma, and other genetic/ congenital causes.

            <h3>How is cataract treated ?</h3>
            <div class="cbd-card-content">
              <p>
                Cataract surgery is a safe and highly developed treatment for
                removing the cloudy cataract and replacing it with an artificial
                lens. This is done through a very small incision on the clear
                part of the eye. The incision is so small it usually self-seals
                and doesnâ€™t require sutures. The vast majority of cataract
                patients have no complications during or following the surgery.
                A full recovery from surgery can range from a short few days to
                few months. Most patients will see clearer the next day after
                surgery.

            <h3>What are the benefits of surgical correction?</h3>
            <div class="cbd-card-content">
              <p>The main benefits of cataract surgery include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Improving your vision.</li>
                <li>Improve the symptoms caused by cataracts</li>
                <li>
                  In some patients, cataract surgery is required to control eye
                  pressure.

          <div class="cbd-card wow animate__fadeIn">
            <h3>What are the risks or side effects of the operation?</h3>
            <div class="cbd-card-content">
              <strong>Gritty discomfort in the eye</strong>
              <p>
                This is common the next day after surgery, and it should resolve
                within hours.
              </p>
              <strong>Inflammation</strong>
              <p>
                This is common following surgery of the eye, the eyedrops
                prescribed will be helpful in settling this.
              </p>
              <strong>Swelling</strong>
              <p>
                In the eye, swelling can offer in the front of the eye (cornea)
                or the back of the eye following surgery. Most of these will
                usually resolve with eye drops.
              </p>
              <strong>Need for glasses</strong>
              <p>
                It is common that most patient will need glasses if not for
                near, then for distance sometimes. This will be discussed during
                your consultations.
              </p>
              <strong>Second operation</strong>
              <p>
                While the aim of the surgery is to take the cataract out,
                sometimes the cataract may escape deeper into the eye. If this
                happens, a second surgery will be required to remove the
                cataract completely. Your vision may be blurred during before
                the second surgery is complete. Retinal detachment occurring
                after cataract surgery is uncommon, this will also require a
                second surgery to repair the retina.
              </p>
              <strong>Infection</strong>
              <p>
                This complication while rare (&lt;1:1000), can be sight
                threatening. If your operated eye becomes red, painful and
                vision drops few days after surgery, please contact the surgery
                urgently or go to the nearest emergency department immediately.
              </p>
              <strong>Posterior capsular opacification</strong>
              <p>
                It can be common to see that the artificial lens becomes a bit
                cloudy (which may mimick cataracts again). This can be easily
                cleaned by our doctors using lasers in eye clinic.

                involves. You will also under precise measurement of the
                dimensions of your eye. This allows us to determine the best
                lens to replace the natural lens.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you wear contact lenses, please ensure you stop using them

              On the day of surgery, you will first attend the CBD eye clinic to
              check in and have eye drops in the eye. The eyedrops will dilate
              the pupil of the eye planned for surgery. When the dilating drops
              have worked, we will guide you to the operating theaters of Sydney
              Eye Hospital. Which is just a short walk away.

              <p>
                The cataract surgery is done under local anaesthesia. It will
                involve that you relax and lie flat on your back during the
                operation. Vast majority of the surgery will take about 10mins,
                however more complex cases may take longer depending on the
                condition of the cataract.
              </p>
              <p>
                After the surgery, there will be an eye patch covering the
                operated eye. Please ensure that you have friend or family who
                will be able to take you home and look after you
