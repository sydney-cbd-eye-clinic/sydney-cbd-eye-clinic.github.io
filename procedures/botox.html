            <!-- <p>
              This is a form of surgical procedure which changes refractive
              (focusing) power of the eye with a beam of light through gentle
              recontouring of the cornea (front window of the eye) in order to
              improve vision.

            <h3>What causes Refractive errors ?</h3>
            <div class="cbd-card-content">
              <p>
                The eye is like a camera with great focusing power through the
                shape of the cornea and lens. These main focusing elements can
                be insufficient or excessive in their ability to help the eye
                focus – which may sometimes be referred to as refractive error.
                One of the ways these refractive errors such as being
                near-sightedness (myopia), far-sightedness (hyperopia), or
                having astigmatism can be corrected is by reshaping the cornea.
              </p>

            <h3>How was LASIK work ?</h3>
            <div class="cbd-card-content">
              <p>
                The laser light allows the removal of a microscopic slice of
                tissue in order to reshape the front surface of the eye. It may
                flatten the cornea (to improve near-sightedness), steepen the
                cornea (to treat far-sightedness) or even smooth out the surface
                (to treat astigmatism).

            <h3>What are the benefits of surgical correction?</h3>
            <div class="cbd-card-content">
              <p>
                Many patients enjoy being glasses free after their refractive
                error is corrected through surgery.

            <h3>What are the risks or side effects of the operation?</h3>
            <div class="cbd-card-content">
              <p>
                Laser correction with LASIK or PRK has been a long standing,
                tested way of treating refractive error and patients generally
                enjoy excellent outcomes. The technology has various safeguards
                in place to minimise the risk of errors and the surgeon is in
                full control of the laser during the treatment.
              </p>
              <p>
                With any procedures there are always small degrees of risk,
                however. These may include dry eyes, night-time glare. These
                problems usually improve after a few months.
              </p>
              <p>Other risks include:</p>
              <li>Undercorrections – when not enough tissue is removed</li>
              <li>Overcorrections – when too much tissue is removed.</li>
              <li>Astigmatism – when there is uneven removal of tissue.</li>
              <li>
                Flap problems / infections – The flap created by the laser may
                be subject to dislodgement, infections, or abnormal growth of
                cells underneath it.
              </li>
              <li>
                Regression – When your vision is slowly reverts back to your
                original prescription and is generally uncommon.
              </li>
              <li>
                Reduced vision – The risk of any harm of loss of vision is
                extremely rare

              <p>The laser treatment takes about 10-15minutes per eye.</p>
