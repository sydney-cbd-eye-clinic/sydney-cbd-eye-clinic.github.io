                <h1>Entropion</h1>
                <p>Entropion is the medical term used to describe rolling inward of the lower eyelid and eyelashes
                    towards the eyeball.</p>
                <p>The skin of the eyelid and the eyelashes rub against the cornea (the front part of the eye) and
                    conjunctiva (the membrane that protects the eye). This rubbing can lead to excessive tearing,
                    crusting of the eyelid, mucous discharge, foreign body sensation in the eye, irritation of the
                    cornea and impaired vision.</p>

                <h3>What causes entropion?</h3>
                <div class="cbd-card-content">
                    <p>Most cases of entropion are due to weakening of the tissues and small muscles of the eyelid as a
                        result of ageing. Some cases result from scarring of the inner surface of the eyelid caused by
                        chemical and thermal burns, inflammatory diseases such as blepharitis, ocular pemphigoid, or
                        allergic reactions.

                <h3>How is entropion treated?</h3>
                <div class="cbd-card-content">
                    <p>
                        Entropion should be repaired surgically before the rubbing damages the
                        cornea by causing infection and scarring. Prior to surgery, the eye can be
                        protected by taping the lowerlid down and using lubricating drops and
                        ointment. In some cases, stitches can be placed through the lower eyelid
                        until more definitive surgery can be performed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The surgery to repair entropion is usually performed under local
                        anaesthesia as an outpatient. In most cases, your doctor will tighten the
                        eyelid and its attachments. You may have a patch overnight and then will
                        usually use an antibtioic drop or ointment for about a week. After your
                        eyelids heal your eye will feel comfortable and you will no longer have the
                        risk of corneal scarring, infection, and loss of vision..

                <div class="cbd-card-content">
                    <p>
                        The benefits of surgery include:
                    </p>
                    <li> Restoration of the normal appearance and function of the eyelid</li>
                    <li> Relief of symptoms (grittiness, pain, redness of the eye)</li>
                    <li> Reduction of risk of eye infection.</li>

                <h3>What are the risks or side effects of the operation </h3>
                <div class="cbd-card-content">
                    <strong> Mild discomfort </strong>
                    <p>The local anaesthetic wears off in the first 2-4 hours after surgery. After this there may be
                        mild discomfort around the wound. You may take simple pain killers such as paracetamol (Panadol)
                        or ibuprofen(neurofen) if you have no allergies or contraindications to these medications.</p>

                    <strong> Bruising & swelling </strong>
                    <p> If is common to have some bruising and swelling of the eyelid or the surrounding area after
                        eyelid
                        surgery.</p>

                    <strong>Bleeding</strong>
                    <p> There may a small amounts or bleeding or ooze in the hours (or ever few days after surgery).
                        This
                        can be gently dabbed
                        away with a clean gauze.</p>
                    <p> Bleeding may be prolonged in patients who take blood thinners such as aspirin or warfarin.</p>
                    <p> If there is excessive bleeding at any time, please put some gauze over the surgical site and
                        apply firm pressure. If it does not stop please contact us in the rooms.</p>

                    <strong> Small possibility of recurrence or over-correction of the eyelid which may require a
                        further operation.</strong>
                    <p> Depending on the underlying cause sometime the condition may recur once again. Where necessary
                        further surgery can be offered to improve the eyelids at a suitable time.</p>

                    <strong> Infection of the lid or eye. </strong>
                    <p> Infection is rare after eyelid surgery. It may cause the eyelid to become increasingly red,
                        swollen and tender a few days after surgery with some associated discharge.</p>
                    <p> If this occurs, please contact us for review as you may require antibiotics.</p>

                    <strong> Allergic reaction to the local anaesthetic or the antibiotic drops. </strong>
                    <p> Certain individuals may be allergic to the anaesthetic or antibiotic medications.</p>
                    <p> During the consultation a detailed history will be taken and necessary steps taken to avoid use
                        of such medications if there is an allergy.</p>

                    <p>Below are some points to be mindful of following surgery:
                    </p>
                    <strong>Eye patch</strong>
                    <p>You may have an eye patch over-night and will be prescribed antibiotic eyedrops or ointment for
                        about a week. If surgery is done to both eyes, one patch will be removed before you leave the
                        surgery.</p>
                    <strong>Sutures</strong>
                    <p>These are generally removed between 7-10 days after the surgery.</p>
                    <strong> Returning home after surgery</strong>
                    <p> It would be ideal to have someone (friend or family) to take you home or arrange a taxi.</p>
                    <strong> At home</strong>
                    <p> Vision may seem a bit smeary following surgery or from the ointment prescribed.</p>
                    <p> Please take care not to rub on or near the surgical wound for at least 7 days.</p>
                    <strong> Post-operative ointment</strong>
                    <p> Please use Chlorsig eyedrops to use 3 times during the day and ointment at night. The ointment
                        can also be applied to the skin wound.</p>
                    <p> This is used for 1-2 weeks following surgery</p>
