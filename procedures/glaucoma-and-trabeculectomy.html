            <h1>Glaucoma Surgery (Trabeculectomy)</h1>
            <p>
              Glaucoma is an eye condition where the nerve at the back of the
              eye (the optic nerve) is damaged. This can lead to loss of vision.
              In most cases, the damage to the optic nerve is due to an
              increased pressure within the eye. There are different types of
              glaucoma.

            <h3>Why do I need an operation for this ?</h3>
            <div class="cbd-card-content">
              <p>
                Glaucoma can slowly damage the eyesight. We cannot recover the
                sight once you lose part of your eyesight due to glaucoma. In
                this condition, there is often a problem with the pressure in
                the eye (intraocular pressure). The higher the pressure, the
                greater the chance of losing vision. In some patients, glaucoma
                may still progress despite a seemingly normal pressure. The key
                aim of surgery is to lower the pressure to prevent any further
                glaucoma damage.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the eye clinic we will monitor your eye pressure, field of
                vision and 3D scan of your nerve. If eye drops fail to keep the
                pressure low enough, our doctor may recommend surgery for you.
                The operation does not recover any lost vision, its goal is to
                prevent further loss of vision from glaucoma by reducing the eye
                pressure.

            <h3>What are the benefits of surgical correction?</h3>
            <div class="cbd-card-content">
              <p>
                The operation has a good success rate approximately 9 out of 10
                patients will see a pressure reduction after the surgery. When
                the pressure is surgically lowered, you may be able to stop the
                eyedrops used to treat glaucoma.

            <h3>What are the risks or side effects of the operation?</h3>
            <div class="cbd-card-content">
              <p>
                Any operation can potentially have complications. After glaucoma
                surgery it is uncommon to have a bad outcome. You can expect the
                eye to be sore and blurred for a few days to weeks with gritty
                sensation.
              </p>
              <p>
                Infection or severe bleeding is uncommon, however if your eye
                becomes red and painful with reduction in vision please contact
                us as soon as possible.
              </p>
              <p>
                If the eye pressure reduction is sub-optimal you may need to go
                back onto eye drops, have laser treatment or have a second
                operation.
              </p>
              <p>
                A proportion of patient may go onto to develop cataracts in the
                operated eye. We will monitor this and will address this for you
                if it affects your vision.

            <h3>Are there any alternative treatments?</h3>
            <div class="cbd-card-content">
              <p>
                Some alternatives to surgery include using eyedrops or laser
                treatment. These are often tried first before reaching the
                surgical stage. However in some cases surgery may have to be
                done sooner rather than trying eyedrops or laser (for instance,
                where advanced disease is detected in a young patient). If the
                operation is not done, and other treatment methods have already
                been tried, there is a risk of slowly losing vision because of
                your glaucoma
