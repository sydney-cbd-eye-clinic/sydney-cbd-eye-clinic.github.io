            <h1>Ptosis (Droopy eyelids)</h1>
            <p>
              Ptosis is the medical name for droopy upper eyelids, which may
              occur in one or both eyes. The low lying eyelids can interfere
              with vision by affecting the top part of the visual field and
              present as a cosmetic issue for some.
            </p>

            <p>
              Patients might have difficulty keeping their eyelids open,
              eyestrain or eyebrow ache from increased effort needed to raise
              the eyelids, and fatigue, especially when reading.

            <h3>What causes Ptosis?</h3>
            <div class="cbd-card-content">
              <p>
                Ptosis most commonly occurs with aging, but can also be present
                from birth (congenital). It can also be caused by long-term
                contact lens wear, trauma, eye surgery (including cataract
                surgery) and occasionally neurological or muscle disease.
              </p>

            <h3>How is ptosis treated?</h3>
            <div class="cbd-card-content">
              <p>
                The most common ptosis operation involves
                re-attaching/shortening/tightening of the muscle that raise the
                lid (the levator palpebrae superioris muscle). An incision is
                made in the skin in the existing eyelid crease (skin fold) to
                access the muscle. It is then reattached to the rigid tissue in
                the eyelid with sutures that either dissolve or remain under the
                skin surface . Ptosis surgery can be combined with removing
                excess skin in the upper eyelid (blepharoplasty).
              </p>
              <p>
                Surgical technique used will be different depending on the cause
                of the ptosis. We will discuss in detail the necessary procedure
                needed to correct ptosis during the consultation.

            <h3>What are the benefits of surgical correction?</h3>
            <div class="cbd-card-content">
              <p>
                The aim of the surgery is to lift the droopy eyelid and achieve
                the following:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Improve the upper field of vision</li>
                <li>
                  Achieve a symmetrical height between the right and left sides
                </li>
                <li>
                  Achieve a natural and symmetrical curve or contour of the
                  upper lid
                </li>
                <li>Retain the ability to fully close the eye</li>
                <li>Improve the appearance of the eyelids.</li>
              </ul>

          </div>
          <div class="cbd-card wow animate__fadeIn">
            <h3>What are the risks or side effects of the operation?</h3>
            <div class="cbd-card-content">
              <strong>Unsatisfactory eyelid position</strong>
              <p>
                About 90-95% of patients are corrected satisfactorily after the
                first operation. Approximately 5-10% may require a further
                surgery to adjust one or both eyelids.
              </p>
              <strong>Recurrence</strong>
              <p>
                The droopy eyelid can reoccur, although usually many years after
                the initial operation. A repeat procedure can be done to correct
                this again. Repeat surgery such as this can be more complicated
                to undertake.
              </p>
              <strong>Pain</strong>
              <p>
                The local anaesthetic wears off in the first 2-4 hours after
                surgery. After this there may be mild discomfort around the
                wound. You may take simple pain killers such as paracetamol
                (Panadol) or ibuprofen(neurofen) if you have no allergies or
                contraindications to these medications.
              </p>
              <strong>Bruising</strong>
              <p>
                It is common to have some bruising and swelling of the eyelid or
                the surrounding area after eyelid surgery.
              </p>
              <strong>Bleeding</strong>
              <p>
                There may a small amounts or bleeding or ooze in the hours (or
                ever few days after surgery). This can be gently dabbed away
                with a clean gauze.
              </p>
              <p>
                Bleeding may be prolonged in patients who take blood thinners
                such as aspirin or warfarin.
              </p>
              <p>
                If there is excessive bleeding at any time, please put some
                gauze over the surgical site and apply firm pressure. If it does
                not stop please contact us in the rooms.
              </p>
              <strong>Infection</strong>
              <p>
                Infection is uncommon after eyelid surgery, although any wound
                can become infected. This may be treated with antibiotics
              </p>
              <strong>Poor eyelid closure</strong>
              <p>
                It is not uncommon to have a small gap between the eyelids when
                sleeping immediately following surgery. Eye lubricating cream
                can be used to keep the surface moist and comfortable the this
                usually settles with time.
              </p>
              <p>
                Rarely, if the eyelid is overcorrected (too high), massaging the
                lid with a controlled downward manner can be performed to lower
                the lid, or revision surgery may be required.
              </p>
              <p>
                If the eye feel dry or gritty additional artificial tears or
                ointment may be used.
              </p>
              <strong>Changes to vision</strong>
              <p>
                There is a tiny (less than 1 in 10,000) risk of adversely
                affecting vision with any eyelid procedure. This is very rare.

                The surgery to repair ectropion is usually performed under local

            <div class="cbd-card-content">
              <p>Below are some points to be mindful of following surgery:</p>
              <strong>Eye patch</strong>
              <p>
                You may have an eye patch over-night and will be prescribed
                antibiotic eyedrops or ointment for about a week. If surgery is
                done to both eyes, one patch will be removed before you leave
                the surgery.
              </p>
              <strong>Sutures</strong>
              <p>
                These are generally removed between 7-10 days after the surgery.
              </p>
              <strong> Returning home after surgery</strong>
              <p>
                It would be ideal to have someone (friend or family) to take you
                home or arrange a taxi.
              </p>
              <strong> At home</strong>
              <p>
                Vision may seem a bit smeary following surgery or from the
                ointment prescribed.
              </p>
              <p>
                Please take care not to rub on or near the surgical wound for at
                least 7 days.
              </p>
              <strong> Post-operative ointment</strong>
              <p>
                Please use Chlorsig eyedrops to use 3 times during the day and
                ointment at night. The ointment can also be applied to the skin
                wound.
              </p>
