                <h3>What is Migraines?
                </h3>
                <div class="cbd-card-content">
                    <p>Migraines are the most common type of primary headache, affecting millions of Americans. Women are more likely to get migraines than men. The exact cause is not fully understood. It may be related to swelling of blood vessels in the head, due to unusual levels of certain substances in the brain. People who get migraines may have abnormalities in the genes that control certain brain cells. <br>

                        Whatever the cause, the result is throbbing, moderate to severe pain, often on one side of the head. Some people feel sick to their stomach and might throw up. Migraines can last from a few hours to one or two days. When migraines happen frequently, they can interfere with work, family time and other activities. <br>
                        
                        Some people can tell they are about to have a migraine because they have visual signs, such as seeing flashes or lines across their field of vision. Many things can possibly trigger a migraine, such as:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Sleeping too much or not enough</li>
                            <li>Alcohol, especially red wine</li>
                            <li>Certain foods, or certain chemicals in food</li>
                            <li>Stress and anxiety</li>
                            <li>In women, hormonal changes before, during or after your period</li>
                        </ul>
                        </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="cbd-card wow animate__fadeIn">
                <h3>How is it treated?</h3>
                <div class="cbd-card-content">
                    <p>Treatment often includes medication to relieve the symptoms, usually in pill form. Itâ€™s best to take these drugs as soon as you realize you are getting a migraine. One commonly used drug is sumatriptan. Steroids or narcotics are used in some cases, with care taken to avoid side effects and complications. <br>

                        If you get more than three or four migraines each month, you might need preventive medication, which might include certain kinds of cardiovascular, anti-seizure or anti-depressant drugs. These drugs are taken daily to prevent migraines or reduce their frequency. Regular OnabotulinumtoxinA (Botox) injections help some adults. <br>
                        
                        Stress management strategies, regular physical activity and other lifestyle changes may help prevent migraines or reduce their intensity. Therapy using biofeedback and other methods may reduce the number and severity of migraine attacks. Keeping a journal of your headaches can help you pinpoint possible triggers so you can make helpful changes. <br>
                        
                        In women, hormone therapy can be helpful if migraines are related to the menstrual cycle.
