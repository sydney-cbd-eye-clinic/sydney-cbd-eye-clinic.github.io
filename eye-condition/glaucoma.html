            <h1>Glaucoma</h1>
            <p>
              Glaucoma refers to a groups of disease that can affect the optic
              nerve, leading to loss of vision.

            <h3>What is Glaucoma?</h3>
            <div class="cbd-card-content">
              <p>
                Glaucoma is sometimes called the “silent thief of sight,”
                because it often has no symptoms until the disease becomes very
                advanced. Once glaucoma has damaged your vision, it can never be
                regained. The optic nerve is made up of a large number of nerve
                fibers, and its job is to carry the images we see from our eyes
                to our brains. When fluid pressure in the inner eye increases,
                these optic nerve fibers can be damaged, causing blind spots to
                develop. Usually, people don’t notice these blinded areas until
                a large portion of the optic nerve has already become damaged.
                If the entire nerve is destroyed, blindness results.

            <h3>What causes Glaucoma?</h3>
            <div class="cbd-card-content">
              <p>
                The causes of glaucoma can be complex and is an area undergoing
                ongoing research. In general, the condition can be broadly
                classified into two types:
                <br />
                <strong> OPEN-ANGLE GLAUCOMA :</strong>
                <br />
                This is the most common type of glaucoma. Open-angle glaucoma
                occurs when the drainage angle of the eye becomes less efficient
                with time, and pressure within the eye gradually increases. If
                this increased pressure results in optic nerve damage, it is
                known as chronic open-angle glaucoma. Over 90% of adult glaucoma
                patients have this type of glaucoma. SYMPTOMS Chronic open-angle
                glaucoma damages vision so gradually and painlessly that you may
                not be aware of trouble. Initially, blind spots may develop, but
                these can go unnoticed until the optic nerve is already badly
                damaged.
                <br />
                <strong> ANGLE-CLOSURE GLAUCOMA :</strong>
                <br />
                Sometimes the drainage angle of the eye may become completely
                blocked. It’s as though a sheet of paper floating near a drain
                suddenly drops over the opening and blocks the flow out of the
                sink. In the eye, the iris (the part that makes your eyes blue
                or brown) may act like the sheet of paper closing off the
                drainage angle. When eye pressure builds up suddenly, it is
                called acute angle-closure glaucoma.

            <h3>SYMPTOMS</h3>
            <div class="cbd-card-content">
              <p>
                If you have any of these symptoms, call your eye care specialist
                immediately: 
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Blurred vision</li>
                <li>Severe eye pain</li>
                <li>Headache</li>
                <li>Rainbow halos around lights</li>
                <li>Nausea and vomiting</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Unless a doctor treats acute angle-closure glaucoma quickly,
                blindness can result due to high pressure. In some patients, the
                disease has the features of both chronic open-angle glaucoma
                acute angle-closure glaucoma. This may be called “chronic angle
                closure glaucoma” or “mixed mechanism glaucoma.

            <h3>How is it treated?</h3>
            <div class="cbd-card-content">
              <p>
                There are three types of treatments for glaucoma: eye drops,
                laser surgery, and filtration surgery. Loss of vision from
                glaucoma is often preventable, however, if it is treated in the
                beginning stages. Early detection is key to preventing optic
                nerve damage and blindness.

            <h3>Who is at risk for glaucoma?</h3>
            <div class="cbd-card-content">
              <p>
                High pressure within the inner eye does not necessarily mean
                that you have glaucoma. Your glaucoma specialist will put
                together many different pieces of information to determine your
                risk for developing the disease. The most important risk factors
                include:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Age</li>
                <li>Family history of glaucoma</li>
                <li>Past injuries to the eyes</li>
                <li>African ancestry</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Your eye care specialist will weigh all of these factors before
                deciding whether you need treatment for glaucoma, or whether you
                should be monitored closely as a glaucoma suspect. This means
                your risk of developing glaucoma is higher than normal, and you
                need to have regular examinations to detect early signs of
                damage to the optic nerve.

            <h3>How is glaucoma detected?</h3>
            <div class="cbd-card-content">
              <p>
                Regular eye examinations are the best way to detect and treat
                glaucoma. During a complete and painless examination, your eye
                doctor will:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Measure your intraocular pressure (tonometry)</li>
                <li>Evaluate any optic nerve damage (ophthalmoscopy)</li>
                <li>
                  If necessary, your eye doctor may do additional testing
                  including:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Inspect the drainage angle of your eye (gonioscopy)</li>
                    <li>Test the visual field of each eye (perimetry)</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Some of these tests may not be necessary for every person. If
                you have glaucoma, you will need to repeat these tests on a
                regular basis to determine if glaucoma increasing over time.

            <h3>Glaucoma prevention</h3>
            <div class="cbd-card-content">
              <p>
                Regular yearly eye exams may help prevent unnecessary vision
                loss to glaucoma. Treatment for glaucoma requires teamwork
                between you and your eye doctor. Your glaucoma specialist can
                prescribe treatment for the disease, but only you can make sure
                you take your glaucoma eye drops. Never stop taking or change
                your glaucoma medications without first consulting with your eye
                doctor. Frequent eye examinations and tests are critical to
                monitor your eyes for any changes. Remember, it is your vision,
                and you must do your part to maintain it!
