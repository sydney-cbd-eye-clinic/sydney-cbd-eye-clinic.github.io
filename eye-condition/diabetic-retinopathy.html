              <p>
                High blood sugar levels are harmful to the fine vessels within
                your eye. In the early stages, diabetic eye disease often has no
                symptoms. Regular eye exams are extremely important if you have
                diabetes mellitus. Just like visiting your endocrinologist to
                monitor your blood glucose levels over time, keeping your vision
                appointments can help decrease your risk of disease and protect
                your vision. High blood sugar levels can damage blood vessels in
                the retina, which can cause swelling, inadequate blood flow to
                the eye, and blurred vision. If left untreated, diabetic
                retinopathy can lead to vitreous hemorrhaging, retinal
                detachment, and glaucoma. If you are diagnosed with diabetic
                retinopathy, there are several treatment options. Your doctor
                will help you determine the best treatment plan for your
                diagnosis.

            <h3>How is D.R. diagnosed?</h3>
            <div class="cbd-card-content">
              <p>
                IA medical eye examination can find changes inside your eye. An
                eye care specialist can often diagnose and treat serious
                retinopathy before you are aware of any vision problems. Your
                doctor dilates your pupil and looks at the inside of your eye.
                If your eye doctor finds diabetic retinopathy, he or she may
                order color photographs of the retina and a special test called
                fluorescein angiography to find out if you need treatment. In
                this test, fluorescent dye is injected into a vein in your arm
                and your eye is photographed as the dye passes through the blood
                vessels in the back of the eye.

                The best treatment for diabetic retinopathy is to prevent it’s
                development. Strict control of your blood sugar will
                significantly reduce the long-term risk of vision loss from
                diabetic retinopathy. If high blood pressure and kidney problems
                are present, they need to be treated. Intravitreal injection
                into the eye are often used to reduce fluid leakage and treat
                diabetic macular oedema (Swelling of the macula – causing
                reduced vision). On the other hand, laser treatment is often
                recommended for people with PDR and neovascular glaucoma. The
                main goal of treatment is to prevent further loss of vision. For
                PDR, the laser is focused on all parts of the retina except the
                macula. This panretinal photocoagulation treatment causes
                abnormal new vessels to shrink and often prevents them from
                growing in the future. It also decreases the chance that
                vitreous bleeding or retinal distortion will occur. Recently,
                eye injections have become a useful tool in the management of
                diabetic retinopathy. Multiple eye injections or laser
                treatments over time are sometimes necessary. These procedures
                do not cure diabetic retinopathy and does not always prevent
                further loss of vision. Sometimes, in severe cases, a patient
                may need to see a retina specialist to discuss more involved
                surgery.

            <h3>What are the risks?</h3>
            <div class="cbd-card-content">
              <p>
                Vision loss due to diabetic retinopathy is preventable! If you
                have diabetes, it is important to know that today, with improved
                methods of diagnosis and treatment, only a small percentage of
                people who develop retinopathy have serious vision problems.
                Early detection of diabetic retinopathy is the best protection
                against loss of vision. You can significantly lower your risk of
                vision loss by maintaining strict control of your blood sugar
                and visiting your eye care specialist regularly.
