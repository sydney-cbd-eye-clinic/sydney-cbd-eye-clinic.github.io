                <h3>How is it treated?</h3>
                <div class="cbd-card-content">
                    <p>Several treatment options can ease the symptoms of dry eye syndrome. Some of the most common treatments include: 
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> LipiFlow </li>
                        <li> Artificial tears (available in over-the-counter)</li>
                        <li> Omega 3 Fatty Acid Oils (a dietary supplement)</li>
                        <li> Restasis (a prescription medication drop)</li>
                        <li> Punctal Plugs (silicone plugs that reduce the natural drainage of tears out of the eye)</li>
                           
                    </ul>
                    <p>In healthy eyes, a thin layer of tears coats the outside surface of the eye and keeps it moist. Dry eye syndrome occurs when the eye doesn’t make enough tears, produces ineffective tears, or when the tears evaporate too quickly. This can lead to dryness, stickiness, and stinging or burning of the eyes. Sometimes the eyes water excessively in an effort to soothe the irritation, but these reflex tears are usually not enough to fix the problem.

                        Dry eye syndrome affects women two to three times more often than men—a statistic thought to be attributable to hormones. Male testosterone seems to be good for the tear glands, while estrogen in women has the opposite effect. In fact, in a recent study, women who were on hormone replacement therapy after menopause had up to a 70% higher risk for developing dry eyes than women not using hormone replacement therapy.
                        
                        If you experience dry eye conditions, don’t delay in speaking with your doctor. Dry eye syndrome is more than a nuisance—left untreated, severe cases can lead to inflammation, infection, and scarring of the eye surface that can result in permanent sight loss.
                        
                        Today, there are many treatment options to help those who sufferer from Dry Eye:
                       <br>
                        <strong>Environmental Treatments :</strong>
                        <br>
                        Often, small adjustments to your daily habits—such as smoking cessation or aiming heating and air-conditioning ducts away from your face—can lead to improvement.
                       
                       <br> <strong>Dietary Treatments :</strong>
                       <br>
                        Diets high in the omega-3 fatty acids found fish, nuts, or supplements can also reduce dry eye symptoms.
                        <br>
                         <strong>Medical Treatments :</strong>
                         <br>
                        For others, tear replacement drops can help re-establish moisture to the eye or small plugs placed in the tear ducts can prevent tears from draining away too quickly. In addition, a new prescription medication called cyclosporin—marketed under the brand name Restasis®—is now available to help your tear glands produce more of your own natural tears.</p>
