                    <p>I began seeing Dr Lowe five years ago when I became legally blind through dehydration and renal
                        failure. I only had less
                        than 10% field of vision in my right eye and total loss in my left eye. Other opthamologists had
                        told me there was
                        nothing to be done. One of the opthamologists told me about Dr Lowe. After 6 months I had
                        regained color and definition
                        in my remaining vision. How do you thank someone for bringing colour back to your world? I can't
                        recommend Dr Lowe and
                        his team enough

                    <p>I visited Dr Dennis Lowe for a pterygium operation. He was the third specialist I had visited and
                        this was the second
                        operation I had had, so I knew what to expect. Or thought I did. The prompt service (never kept
                        waiting for more than 20
                        minutes), the efficiency and thoroughness of the staff was better than I have experienced in any
                        medical facility. As
                        too, was the knowledge and expertise of all of the staff I had contact with. Clearly this is a
                        place which sets very
                        high standards and the staff take a true interest in their work. I found this review website

                        an address to send my thank you card to.
